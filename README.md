# Super Scrapper

###### -- Testing Testing --


### Structure

Currently the repo is structured with a database file and a scraper file.
If you want to setup different stuff and change things around go ahead. This is by all means just an inital setup.
The scraper file contains an instance of a scrapy project, this file structrure is important to the scraper operation, ask if you want to shift stuff in it around.

At some point it would be nice to add some other sections for and if we build UI/UX and other software

### Examples

Examples:
	- Database example - A python file that runs a basic mongodb connection operation


### Instructions

For instructions concering the database use the example above.

Hamish(me currently) will be adding some stuff on how to setup and use the scraper

Ask if you want to know how to do anything or use anything.
