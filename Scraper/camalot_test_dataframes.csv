1,The Fund invests primarily in Australian listed companies included in the S&P/ASX300 Index and will also have,,
2,"some exposure to cash. Typically, the Fund is highly concentrated with 15-30 stocks.",,
3,Direct and indirect investments,,
4,"In addition to holding direct assets, the Fund may also make investments indirectly, for example by investing in",,
5,other managed funds where these are aligned with the Fund’s investment strategy.,,
6,Any costs associated with these investments are outlined in ‘Fees and costs’.,,
7,Borrowing,,
8,"Whilst the Fund’s constitution permits borrowing and is not restricted in its borrowing levels, the Responsible",,
9,Entity does not intend to borrow on behalf of the Fund. The Fund will not use derivatives for gearing purposes.,,
10,Change to Fund details,,
11,"We have the right to change the Fund’s asset classes, asset allocation ranges and investment return objectives",,
12,without prior notice. We will inform investors of any material change to the Fund’s details via,,

14,Additional information about the Fund’s strategy,,
15,Investment strategy,,
16,Hyperion is a high conviction growth style manager that specialises in identifying and investing in high-quality,,
17,Australian and global equities. Hyperion’s proprietary investment process aims to produce a relatively,,
18,concentrated portfolio of high-quality companies with predictable earnings and superior growth potential.,,
19,Hyperion’s competitive advantage is summarised in three points:,,
0,Australian and global equities. Hyperion’s proprietary investment process aims to produce a relatively,,
1,concentrated portfolio of high-quality companies with predictable earnings and superior growth potential.,,
2,Hyperion’s competitive advantage is summarised in three points:,,
3,•,Process – Hyperion buys the highest quality growth businesses at an attractive valuation based on a,
4,,"thoroughly researched long-term view. Hyperion exploits other market participants’ focus on the short-term,",
5,,"market sentiment and indices because Hyperion thinks and acts more like a business owner, rather than a",
6,,stock picker;,
7,•,"People – The core investment team has been together since 1998 and remains stable, experienced and well-",
8,,resourced to handle future growth. The same team that developed their proprietary investment process are,
9,,shareholders in the company as well as having substantial personal investments in their managed products.,
10,,"The result is that clients can feel confident Hyperion’s objectives are fully aligned with theirs; and,",
11,•,Product – Hyperion’s process aims to produce high conviction benchmark insensitive portfolios with excellent,
12,,after-tax efficiency. Hyperion has an established long-term track record of outperformance and is well,
13,,positioned for both the peaks and troughs of an equity investment cycle.,
0,Philosophy and Process,,
1,Hyperion believes that it can achieve consistent above average investment returns over a rolling five-year period,,
2,"by investing in high quality, predictable businesses with superior growth prospects and attractive risk-adjusted",,
3,return profiles.,,
4,Hyperion’s broad investment philosophy has three key elements:,,
5,1.  High quality growth companies outperform over the long run,,
0,Hyperion’s broad investment philosophy has three key elements:,,
1,1.  High quality growth companies outperform over the long run,,
2,,"Market inefficiency expectation: Market participants are more focused on short-term trading, short-term",
3,,"price-to-earnings ratio based mean reversion and short-term earnings revisions, than on proven business",
4,,quality and long-term intrinsic value.,
5,,Hyperion focuses on identifying proven high-quality businesses with superior long-term structural growth,
6,,opportunities arising from their sustainable competitive advantage (including a sound business model and,
7,,proven quality management). Sustained excess growth in earnings and dividends leads to greater returns to,
8,,shareholders over the long-term.,
9,,Identification of high-quality companies with attractive long-term valuation metrics allows Hyperion to target,
10,,strong investment returns with an acceptable level of risk. Hyperion attempts to minimise individual security,
11,,risk by typically holding 15 to 30 companies in portfolios and only investing in the highest quality businesses,
12,,available in the Fund’s universe.,
13,2.,Investments should outperform the risk-free rate,
14,,Market inefficiency expectation: Performance and risk are normally measured against an index by most,
15,,market participants.,
16,,Hyperion structures portfolios with the security weightings determined by forecast long-term risk adjusted,
17,,returns rather than an index weighting. Without an index constraint Hyperion can focus on their clients’,
18,,requirement of sustained long-term wealth creation.,
19,,Hyperion believes that all investments should start with reference to the long-term return available on risk-,
20,,free assets plus a margin that rewards investors for the extra risk of owning equities.,
21,3.,The price one pays determines the ultimate long-term return,
22,,Market inefficiency expectation: Sentiment influences share prices and produces variations to fundamental,
23,,value.,
24,,Hyperion’s portfolio construction matrix provides a valuation-based discipline for buying businesses with,
25,,superior economics at attractive valuations.,
26,,A company’s share price is generally more volatile than the underlying long-term fundamental value of the,
27,,"businesses it owns. Therefore, high levels of share price volatility can provide attractive medium-term",
28,,"investment opportunities over time. In relation to large companies, this is frequently the result of factors such",
29,,"as irrational investor sentiment, momentum trading and institutional “short-termism”. In addition, a lack of",
30,,research coverage regarding small companies can create information asymmetries.,
0,"abour Standards or Environmental, Social or Ethical Considerations",,
1,"Hyperion takes into account labour standards or environmental, social or ethical considerations but only to the",,
2,extent that they will affect the long-term future financial performance of the investment. Hyperion is a signatory,,
3,"to the United Nations-initiated Principles for Responsible Investment (www.unpri.org), which promotes the",,
4,"inclusion of environmental, social and governance issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes.",,
5,"Hyperion believes that labour standards or environmental, social or ethical considerations impact on a company’s",,
6,ability to sustain a competitive advantage in its marketplace. Hyperion believes that companies that do not,,
7,adhere to good practices in labour standards and do not uphold acceptable practices with regard to,,
8,"environmental, social or ethical considerations will be adversely impacted over time by other industry",,
9,"participants, potential new entrants and/or by Government taxes and regulation. Hyperion believes that such",,
10,"companies are unlikely to be able to sustain high rates of return on equity in the long-term. For this reason,",,
11,Hyperion does not invest in companies that do not possess (in Hyperion's judgement) a sustainable competitive,,
12,advantage (‘SCA’).,,
13,The SCA of a company Hyperion invests in is monitored continually as a core part of Hyperion’s investment,,
14,"process. The process of monitoring labour standards or environmental, social or ethical considerations requires a",,
15,judgement as to the effect of those considerations on a company's SCA.,,
0,3. Risks,,
1,Risk profile,,
2,"Depending on the weighting of investments in particular assets, the Fund will have different earnings and risk",,
3,profiles.,,
4,"Generally, the greater the potential return of an investment, the greater the risk of loss. To help understand the",,
5,"correlation between risk and return, investors should refer to the following table where, in the second column",,

4,Low,For investors who are looking for some growth but are mostly concerned,Low
5,,about protecting their capital.,
6,Low-Medium,For investors who are looking for good long-term returns without large ups-,Low-Medium

9,Medium-High,For investors who are prepared to take more risk in exchange for potentially,Medium

13,,Investors should be comfortable with volatility and with the greater,
14,,possibility of negative returns and should aim to invest over a long period.,
15,1.,Past performance is no guide to future performance and cannot be relied upon to predict the future value of an investment.,
0,•,the value of your investment may go up and down;,
1,•,"investment returns may vary, and future returns may be different from past returns;",
2,•,returns are not guaranteed and there is always the chance that you may lose money on any investment you,

0,,make; and,
1,•,"laws affecting your investment may change over time, which may impact the value and returns of your",
2,,investment.,
3,Some of the key risks that may impact the value of your investment in the Fund are outlined below. You need to,,
4,"consider the level of risk that you are comfortable with, taking into account factors such as your objectives,",,
5,financial situation and needs.,,
6,"The Fund will be exposed to risks directly as a managed investment scheme, and indirectly through its investment",,
7,in the underlying assets. The significant risks for the Fund are:,,
8,Concentration risk,,
9,The risk associated with a fund that concentrates its investments in a small number of securities or invests in a,,
10,small subset of an asset class. When investments are concentrated in a smaller number of securities than the,,
11,"broader market index, the unit price of the Fund may be more volatile than the return of the benchmark or a",,
12,more diversified Fund as the returns from the underlying assets are more correlated.,,
13,Counterparty risk,,
14,The Fund relies on external service providers in its normal operations and investment activities. There is a risk,,
15,with external counterparty and service provider arrangements that the party to a contract (such as a derivatives,,
16,"contract, physical security trade or foreign exchange contract) defaults on, or fails to perform, its contractual",,
17,"obligations (either in whole or in part). This may result in a loss for the Fund, or the investment activities of the",,
18,Fund being adversely affected.,,
19,Currency risk,,
20,The Fund may have exposure to currencies other than the Australian dollar. The Fund does not aim to hedge this,,
21,"international currency exposure, and the Fund will be exposed to assets denominated in other currencies.",,
22,Investing in assets denominated in or primarily exposed to a currency other than the Fund’s base currency may,,
23,"cause losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations. For example, an increase in the value of the Australian",,
24,dollar relative to other currencies (that the Fund holds assets in) may negatively impact the value of the,,
25,"investment. Conversely, a decline in the Australian dollar relative to other currencies may positively impact the",,
26,value of the investment.,,
27,Equity security risk,,
28,The Fund primarily invests in equity securities issued by listed companies. An equity security represents,,
29,"ownership interest held by shareholders in an entity (a company, partnership or trust), realized in the form of",,
30,"shares of capital stock, which includes shares of both common and preferred stock.",,
31,"A security’s share price can rise and fall as a consequence of many factors including, but not limited to, economic",,
32,"conditions, changes in interest rates or currency rates, adverse investor sentiment, management performance,",,
33,"financial leverage, reduced demand for the company’s products and services, or factors that affect the company’s",,
34,"industry, including changes in regulation or taxation, as well as competitive conditions within the industry. This",,
35,may result in a loss of value in the portfolio of the Fund and a change in value of your investment.,,
36,"Equity securities may make payments (regular or irregular) as dividends, and these may fluctuate significantly in",,
37,their market value with the ups and downs in the economic cycle and the fortunes of the issuing firm.,,
0,Foreign investment risk,,
1,"The Fund may invest in a range of international securities or foreign investment vehicles, and in companies that",,
2,have exposure to a range of international economies and regulatory environments.,,
3,"Global and country specific macroeconomic factors may impact the Fund’s international investments, and",,
4,"therefore the Fund’s performance. Governments may intervene in markets, industries and companies; may alter",,
5,tax and legal regimes; and may act to prevent or limit the repatriation of foreign capital. Such interventions may,,
6,"impact the Fund’s international investments. Where the Fund is exposed to international investment vehicles, risk",,
7,"that taxation or other applicable laws may change in Australia that may affect the operation of the Fund,",,
8,"including how distributions are paid from the Fund, which may affect the operation of the Fund.",,
9,Income risk,,
10,"The Fund may make payments (regular or irregular) as distributions, depending on the income the Fund receives",,
11,from underlying assets. These may fluctuate significantly in their value with the ups and downs in the economic,,
12,"cycle and the fortunes of the issuing firm. Additionally, the aggregate effect of holding all assets simultaneously",,
13,may result in risk due to the losses from other assets.,,
14,Investment strategy risk,,
15,The success of the Fund depends upon the Investment Manager’s ability to develop and implement investment,,
16,processes and identify investment opportunities that achieve the investment objectives of the Fund. Matters such,,
17,"as the loss of key staff, the Investment Manager’s replacement as investment manager of the Fund, or the",,
18,"investment manager’s failure to perform as expected may negatively impact on returns, risks and/or liquidity.",,
19,"Additionally, the Fund may fail to perform as expected or be able to achieve its stated objectives thereby reducing",,
20,the value of your investment leading to loss.,,
21,Investment structure risk,,
22,"There are risks associated with investing in a managed investment scheme, such as the Fund. These include risks",,
23,"of the Fund’s termination, changes to investment strategy or conditions, changes to fees or expenses, or changes",,
24,"to the Fund’s operating rules (such as payments or reinvestments of distributions, or additional investments). An",,
25,"investment in the Fund is governed by the terms of the constitution and the PDS of the Fund, the Corporations",,
26,"Act 2001 (Cth), and other laws (such as regulatory updates, government policies, or taxation rules). Investing in",,
27,"the Fund results in different performance from holding the underlying assets of the Fund directly, for example",,
28,"because of the aggregate effect of holding all assets simultaneously, or the impact of other investor transactions.",,
29,The Fund may also invest in other managed investment schemes or collective investment vehicles (‘Underlying,,
30,"Fund’), which may suject the Fund to additional risks, including transaction restrictions or liquidity constraints for",,
31,the Underlying Fund.,,
32,Liquidity risk,,
33,Under extreme market conditions there is a risk that investments cannot be readily converted into cash or at an,,
34,"appropriate price, due to the absence of an established market, or where there is a shortage of buyers. The Fund",,
35,"may be unable to liquidate sufficient assets to meet its obligations within required timeframes, including payment",,
36,"of withdrawals, or the Fund it may be required to sell assets at a substantial loss in order to do so.",,
37,"Additionally, different securities may be less liquid than other securities or pose a higher risk of becoming illiquid",,
38,"during times of market stress. The less liquid a security, the less likely it can be bought or sold quickly, the more",,
39,"difficult it may be to sell the security when the investment manager wishes to do so, and the more challenging it",,
40,may be to realise the investment manager’s perception of fair value.,,
0,Market risk,,
1,The Fund has exposure to different financial markets. The risk of an investment in the Fund is higher than an,,
2,investment in a typical bank account investment and the Fund is not expected to behave like a cash investment.,,
3,"Amounts distributed to unitholders may fluctuate, as may the Fund’s unit price.",,
4,"The Fund may be materially affected by market, economic, social and/or political conditions globally and in the",,
5,"jurisdictions and sectors in which it invests or operates. This includes conditions affecting interest rates, the",,
6,"availability of credit, currency exchange and trade barriers. These conditions are outside the control of the Fund",,
7,and could adversely affect the liquidity and value of the Fund’s investments and may reduce the ability of the,,
8,Fund to liquidate its positions or make attractive new investments.,,
9,"The unit price may vary by material amounts, even over short periods of time, including during the period",,
10,between a withdrawal request or application for units being made and the time the withdrawal unit price or,,
11,application unit price is calculated. While the Fund net exposure to share markets may vary through the use of,,
12,derivatives. This means the value of the Fund could fall materially in a short period of time and you could lose,,
13,some or all of your investment.,,
14,Regulatory risk,,
15,"The value of some investments may be adversely affected by changes in Australian government policies,",,
16,"regulations and laws, including tax laws and laws affecting registered managed investment schemes. Changes to",,
17,regulations can affect the Fund’s operation (for example changes to taxation rules can affect the Fund’s income,,
18,"payments), disclosure (for example new regulations may require different information be reported or disclosed",,
19,"compared to current information), or investment activities (for example new regulations or tax rules may prohibit",,
20,or restricts practices or activities the Fund relies on).,,
21,Refer also to ‘Investment structure risk’.,,
22,Unlisted security risk,,
23,"Unlike equity securities, an unlisted security is a stock or other financial instrument that is not traded on a formal",,
24,"exchange. As they are not exchange traded, unlisted securities can be less liquid than listed securities as there",,
25,may not be an established market or market participants may not be as accessible. These also may less,,
26,transparent than listed securities as they are not regulated by an established exchange.,,
27,Refer also to ‘Liquidity risk’.,,
28,Withdrawal risk,,
29,"Even when the Fund is liquid, there may be circumstances where your ability to withdraw from the Fund is",,
30,restricted. These circumstances may include (but are not limited to):,,
0,4. How the Fund works,,
1,How the Fund is valued,,
2,All assets within the Fund are usually valued every Business Day. More frequent valuations are permitted under,,
3,the constitution and we may revalue the Fund’s assets more or less frequently if it is considered appropriate or in,,
4,certain circumstances.,,
5,The Gross Asset Value (‘GAV’) of the Fund equals the market value of the assets. The Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) of,,
6,the Fund attributable to the units is obtained by deducting any liabilities (for example fees and costs) from the,,
7,GAV attributable to the units.,,
8,Unit prices,,
9,"A unit price is calculated for every Business Day, which is equal to the value of the Fund’s net assets attributable",,
10,"to the units divided by the number of units. Generally, the unit price changes daily as the market value of the",,
11,Fund’s assets rises or falls.,,
12,"The Responsible Entity uses independent pricing services provided by the Fund’s Administrator, RBC, for the",,
13,"valuation of the Fund’s assets, which is generally calculated on a daily basis. Listed investments are marked to",,
14,market. The value of unlisted investments is determined by the Responsible Entity after consideration of the,,
15,recommendations from the scheme’s investment manager or the valuation method adopted by an independent,,
16,"third party. Unit prices may be viewed on the Investment Manager’s website, www.hyperion.com.au. Unit prices",,
17,"are based on the NAV of the Fund including provision for income and expenses, which have accrued, and an",,
18,adjustment for a transaction cost factor (see ‘Buy/Sell Spread’ in Section 7 ‘Fees and Costs’).,,
19,The Responsible Entity complies with ASIC Class Order 13/655 as it relates to unit pricing requirements and has,,
20,adopted a compliant policy for unit pricing discretions it uses in relation to the Fund (‘Unit Pricing Policy’). This,,
21,document may be revised or updated to reflect changes in the Fund constitution or the pricing policies of the,,
22,Responsible Entity. Additional documents may be prepared for this purpose from time to time. A copy of the,,
23,"documents outlining the unit pricing methodologies and practices, including information about the",,
24,"circumstances, where the Responsible Entity may exercise discretion in determining a unit price and the value of",,
25,"Fund assets is available on request, at no charge, by calling the Responsible Entity on 1300 010 311.",,
26,Impact of investing just before the end of a distribution period,,
27,"After a distribution is paid, the unit price usually falls by an amount similar to that of the distribution per unit. This",,
28,"means that if you invest just before a distribution, the unit price may already include income that you would be",,
29,"entitled to receive at the distribution date. Consequently, by investing just before a distribution, you may have",,
30,some of your capital returned as income through the distribution payment.,,
31,This could affect your taxation position and we recommend you seek professional taxation advice.,,
0,Distributable income takes into account income received from the investment activities of the Fund less any,,
1,"expenses charged to the Fund, as well as net capital gains made due to trading in the assets of the Fund. Revenue",,
2,losses are not able to be distributed.,,
3,Capital gains are generally not distributed until the end (or shortly thereafter) of the period ending 30 June each,,
4,year. Any net capital losses are carried forward to be offset against capital gains in future income periods.,,
5,Distribution reinvestment,,
6,Distributions will be automatically re-invested unless you advise otherwise.,,
7,The distribution reinvestment price is the unit price at the end of the distribution period (without the applicable,,
8,buy spread) less the distribution per unit payable. All units allotted as part of the distribution reinvestment will,,
9,rank equally in all respects with existing units in the same class. At the time the distribution reinvestment price is,,
10,"set, all information that would, or would be likely to, have a material adverse effect on the realisable price of the",,
11,units will be publicly available.,,
12,Investors may elect to have their distributions paid as cash any time by notifying us or the Registry. The change,,
13,"will apply from the date of receipt, as long as it is at least 10 days prior to a distribution date, or such future date",,
14,as nominated by you.,,
15,The Responsible Entity may cancel or suspend distribution reinvestments or modify the terms by which,,
16,distribution reinvestments are permitted.,,

2,Small differences in both investment performance and fees and costs can have a substantial impact on your long-term,,
3,returns.,,
4,"For example, total annual fees and costs of 2% of your fund balance rather than 1% could reduce your final return by up to",,
5,"20% over a 30-year period (for example, reduce it from $100,000 to $80,000). You should consider whether features such",,

3,1.,Fees are inclusive of GST and net of any applicable Reduced Input Tax Credits (‘RITC’).,
4,2.,"When money moves in or out of the Fund, you may incur a buy/sell spread which is included in the unit price of the Fund. Refe r to ‘Buy/Sell spread’",
5,,below for more information.,
6,3.,"Fees and costs may be negotiated for certain investors such as wholesale clients (as defined in the Corporations Act), depending on factors such as the",
7,,amount invested. Refer to ‘Differential fee arrangements’ below for further information about negotiable fees.,
8,4.,Indirect  costs  refer  to  the  costs  of  obtaining  exposures  through  interposed  vehicles  or  over-the-counter  derivatives  (excluding  over-the  counter,
9,,derivatives used for hedging or risk management purposes) incurred by the Fund.,
10,Additional explanation of fees and costs,,
11,Management costs,,
12,"The management costs, in relation to the Fund, are generally the administration and investment fees and costs",,
13,(excluding transaction costs) of the Fund.,,
14,These costs include (where relevant):,NN,
0,•,replacement of the Responsible Entity.,
1,Buy/sell spread,,
2,The buy/sell spread represents the estimated transaction costs incurred when buying or selling underlying assets,,
3,"in the Fund. When you invest or withdraw from the Fund, this may require changes in the underlying assets that",,
4,incur transaction costs. The purpose of the buy/sell spread is to ensure that only those investors transacting in a,,
5,Fund’s units at a particular time bear the Fund’s costs of buying and selling the Fund’s assets as a consequence of,,
6,their transaction.,,
7,"The buy/sell spread is an additional cost but, as it is included in the unit price, it is not charged to you separately.",,
8,The combined buy and sell spread is the difference between the entry price and the exit price of the units. The,,
9,buy/sell spread is determined by the Responsible Entity to take into account the costs incurred when buying and,,
10,selling the underlying securities in the Fund such as brokerage and stamp duty (if applicable). As at the date of,,
11,"this PDS, the estimated buy/sell spread added on buying or deducted on selling is +0.30%/-0.30% of the unit",,
12,"price. For example, assuming the Fund’s unit price is $1, an application of $50,000 in the Fund will cost the",,
13,"investor $150, and a withdrawal of $50,000 from the Fund will cost the investor $150.",,
14,"From time to time, we may vary the buy/sell spread. Any revised spread will be applied uniformly to transacting",,
15,investors while that spread applies. In circumstances where the Responsible Entity determines that unitholders of,,
16,"the Fund are not being treated equitably (for example, withdrawals in stressed and dislocated markets), the",,
17,buy/sell spread may be higher than our estimate.,,
18,"The Responsible Entity has discretion to waive or reduce the buy/sell spread where the Fund incurs no costs, or",,
19,reduced costs. Investors will be provided with notification of any changes to the buy/sell spread via Hyperion’s,,
20,website at www.hyperion.com.au.,,
21,Total transactional and operational costs,,
22,Transactional and operational costs associated with dealing with the Fund’s assets will be recovered from the,,
23,"Fund. Transactional and operational costs, other than any buy/sell spread, may include brokerage, settlement",,
24,"fees, clearing costs and applicable stamp duty, when underlying assets are bought or sold. In accordance with the",,
25,"Corporations Regulations, an estimate of transactional and operational costs for the Fund is provided below.",,
26,These estimated costs are based on the actual amount for the Fund for the previous financial year.,,
27,"The Responsible Entity, as at the date of this PDS, reasonably estimates that the net transactional and operational",,
28,"costs of the Fund for the current financial year (adjusted to reflect a 12-month period), will be approximately",,
29,"0.07% p.a. of the Fund's NAV or $35 for every $50,000 you have in the Fund. These net transactional and",,
30,operational costs represent estimated total transactional and operational costs (to the extent they can be,,
31,estimated) of 0.21% p.a. minus the estimated transaction costs recovered through the Fund’s combined buy and,,
32,sell spreads. These net transactional and operational costs are borne by the Fund. These costs are in addition to,,
33,the management costs set out above.,,
34,The actual transactional and operational costs payable (if any) will depend on the investments of the Fund and,,
35,the transactional and operational costs estimate provided may not be a reliable indicator of future transactional,,
36,and operational costs of the Fund.,,
37,Transactional and operational costs are paid out of the assets of the Fund and are not paid to Hyperion.,,

4,are investing through. The IDPS operator will be the registered holder of the units and may charge you fees that,,
5,are different or in addition to the Fund’s fees detailed in this section. You should refer to the offer document for,,
6,"the relevant IDPS, master trust or wrap account for more information.",,
7,Differential fee arrangements,,

9,"meaning of the Corporations Act, such as sophisticated or professional investors. In negotiating such fees, we will",,
10,take into consideration our obligations under the Corporations Act. Such arrangements will be by individual,,
11,negotiation and will be disclosed separately to relevant clients. Please contact us on 1300 010 311 for further,,
12,details.,,
13,Changes to fees and other costs,,
14,"We reserve the right to change fees and other costs, subject to any limitations under the Fund constitution and",,
15,applicable law. We will give investors 30 days’ notice prior to increase in any fees.,,
16,The Investment Manager pays costs out of the management fees received. The Fund constitution provides for,,
17,"various fees, specifically an application fee and withdrawal fee which we do not currently recover from the Fund.",,

0,8. Taxation,,
1,WARNING: Investing in a registered managed investment scheme may have tax consequences. You are strongly,,
2,advised to seek professional tax advice.,,
3,"The taxation implications of investing in the Fund can be complex and depend on a number of factors, including",,

5,capital account or revenue account.,,

2,losses in relation to financial arrangements as being on revenue account.,,
3,Taxation of Australian resident investors,,
4,Investors are generally subject to tax on their share of the taxable characters attributed to them by the Fund each,,
5,year. Investors are treated as having derived their share of the taxable characters of the Fund directly on a flow,,
6,through basis.,,
7,The way in which investors are taxed will depend on the underlying nature of each character they receive (for,,
8,"example, franked dividends to which franking credits may attach, capital gains, foreign income to which foreign",,
9,"income tax offsets may attach, or interest income).",,
10,"The AMMA Statement, provided to investors after 30 June each year, will outline the amounts attributed to you",,
11,"by the Fund and the nature of those amounts (i.e. the characters of the total amount attributed), including any",,
12,foreign income tax offsets and franking credit entitlements.,,
13,Capital gains,,
14,"To the extent that an investor is attributed with characters of a capital gain nature, investors will include the",,
15,capital gain in their net capital gain calculation. Certain investors may be entitled to apply the relevant Capital,,
16,Gains Tax (‘CGT’) discount to work out the net capital gain to include in their assessable income (refer further,,
17,comments below).,,
18,Franking credits,,
19,"If franking credits are attributed to investors by the Fund, investors must include the franked dividend income and",,
20,franking credits in their assessable income.,,
21,"Certain requirements, including the 45-day holding period rule, may need to be satisfied in order to obtain",,
22,franking credits in relation to dividends. The investor’s particular circumstances will be relevant to determine,,
23,"whether the investor is entitled to any franking credits, in respect of franked dividends. A tax offset equal to the",,
24,"franking credits will be applied against the tax otherwise payable by investors on their total assessable income,",,
25,subject to the investor satisfying specific conditions. Corporate investors may be entitled to convert any excess,,
26,franking credits into tax losses. Certain other investors may obtain a refund of any excess franking credits.,,
27,Under and overstatements of taxable income,,
28,If the Responsible Entity discovers understatements or overstatements of taxable income and tax offsets in prior,,
29,"years, the Responsible Entity has the ability under the AMIT regime to deal with these understatements and",,
30,overstatements in the financial year in which they are discovered or to carry these forward to be dealt with in a,,
31,"future income year. That is, the distribution statements in the discovery year (or future year) may be adjusted to",,
32,"take into account these understatements or overstatements from a prior financial year, rather than re-issuing",,
33,amended distribution statements for the prior financial year to which the understatements or overstatements,,
34,relate to.,,
35,The amount of attributed income from the Fund which the investor is required to include in their assessable,,
36,income may be different to the cash distributions received by an investor in respect of their units. This is because,,
37,"the distributions received on the units is determined by reference to the returns received in respect of the Fund,",,
38,whereas the attributable income of the Fund is determined by reference to the overall tax position of that Fund.,,
0,"An investor may be required to make, in certain circumstances, both upward and downward adjustments to the",,
1,"cost or cost base of their unit holdings, where there is a difference between the cash amount distributed by the",,
2,Fund and the taxable characters attributed by the Fund to investors for any income year.,,
3,"If the amount of cash received exceeds the taxable characters attributed by the Fund, the cost or cost base of the",,
4,investor’s units in the Fund should be reduced by the excess amount. This results in either an increased capital,,
5,"gain, or a reduced capital loss, upon the subsequent disposal of the investor's units in the Fund. Should the cost",,
6,"base be reduced to below zero, the amount in excess of the cost base should be treated as a capital gain that is to",,
7,be included in the investor's assessable income.,,
8,"Conversely, where the cash amount received falls short of the taxable characters attributed by the Fund during a",,
9,"financial year, the cost or cost base of the investor’s units in the Fund should be increased by the shortfall",,
10,amount.,,
11,Withdrawals from the Fund and disposal of units,,
12,Withdrawal or disposal of a unit in the Fund is the disposal or cancellation of a CGT asset by an investor and a CGT,,
13,"event for tax purposes. To the extent that the proceeds exceed the cost base on the unit, you will make a capital",,
14,"gain. However, if the proceeds are less than your reduced cost base, you will make a capital loss. Generally, a",,
15,capital loss can only be used to offset against capital gains derived in the current or a future tax year.,,
16,"An individual, trust or complying superannuation entity or a life insurance company that holds their units as a",,
17,complying superannuation/FHSA asset may be able to claim the benefit of the CGT discount if they have held the,,
18,units for over 12 months. A corporate investor cannot claim the benefit of the CGT discount. Gains and losses,,
19,realised by an investor who holds their units on revenue account will be taxable as ordinary income or an,,
20,"allowable deduction, as the case may be, and will not qualify for the CGT discount.",,
21,It is important to highlight that on 8 May 2018 the Australian Government announced an integrity measure to,,
22,prevent Managed Investment Trusts (MITs) and AMITs from applying the CGT discount at the trust level. On 30,,
23,"June 2020, the Australian Government announced that the start date that had been previously proposed for this",,
24,measure (being 1 July 2020) would be revised as a result of the reprioritisation of Australian Government,,
25,resources and the shortened parliamentary sitting period in 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. The start date has,,
26,been revised to income years commencing on or after three months after the date of Royal Assent of the enabling,,
27,"legislation. At present, the legislation to introduce this new measure has not yet been released and is still being",,
28,"developed. In this regard, it is recommended that any investors which are MITs or AMITs seek independent",,
29,professional taxation advice in relation to the status of this proposed measure before investing in the Fund.,,
30,Non-resident individual unitholders,,
31,The above taxation summary is only for investors who are residents of Australia for tax purposes. The tax,,
32,treatment of non-resident investors in the Fund depends on the investor’s particular circumstances and the,,
33,provisions of the relevant Double Tax Agreement between Australia and the country of residence. It is important,,
34,that non-resident investors seek independent professional taxation advice before investing in the Fund.,,
35,"The Fund may be required to withhold tax on part, or all, of the distributions made to non-resident investors.",,
36,Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’),,
37,"Unless otherwise stated, the fees quoted in this PDS are inclusive of the net effect of GST and Reduced Input Tax",,
38,Credits (‘RITC’).,,
0,Tax File Numbers and Australian Business Numbers,,
1,"You are not required to quote your Tax File Number (‘TFN’) or, if you have one, an Australian Business Number",,
2,(‘ABN’)<s>1</s> or claim an exemption from providing a TFN.,,
3,"However, if a TFN or ABN is not provided, or an exemption is not claimed, we are required by law to withhold tax",,
4,from distributions at the top marginal tax rate plus the Medicare Levy. If you are making this investment on,,
5,"behalf of a business or enterprise you carry on, you may quote your ABN instead of a TFN.",,
6,Tax reforms,,
7,The expected tax implications of investing in the Fund may change as a result of changes in the taxation laws and,,
8,interpretation of them by the Courts and/or the Australian Tax Office.,,
9,It is recommended that investors obtain independent taxation advice that takes into account your specific,,
10,circumstances regarding investing in the Fund and the potential application of any changes in the tax law.,,
11,Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (‘FATCA’) and OECD Common Reporting,,
12,Standard (‘CRS’),,
13,"Tax evasion is a global problem and international cooperation and sharing of high quality, predictable information",,
14,between revenue authorities will help them ensure compliance with local tax laws. FATCA was enacted by the,,
15,United States (U.S.) Congress to improve compliance with U.S. tax laws by imposing due diligence and reporting,,
16,"obligations on foreign financial institutions, notably the obligation to report U.S. citizen or U.S. tax-resident",,
17,account holders to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (‘IRS’).,,
18,"Similar to FATCA, the CRS for the automatic exchange of information, is a single global standard for the collection",,
19,and reporting to tax authorities of information by financial institutions on non-Australian residents.,,
20,"Accordingly, we may request certain information about yourself (for individual investors) or your controlling",,
21,persons (where you are an entity) in order for the Fund to comply with its FATCA or CRS obligations. In the event,,
22,"that the Fund suffers any amount of withholding tax (including FATCA withholding tax) and/or penalties, neither",,
23,"the Fund nor the Responsible Entity acting on behalf of the Fund, will be required to compensate you for any such",,
24,"tax, except in exceptional circumstances.",,
